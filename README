This is a small real time file reading tool in Scala.
It uses Unfiltered with pattern matching for queries and ajax queries in a javascript interval.
The interesting part of this project is the server. The client is just a quick example of how one
can use the tool.

Conceived and programmed by:

  - Ronan Letellier <ronan@gimmickit.org>
  - Alexandre Berthaud <alexandre@berthaud.me>
